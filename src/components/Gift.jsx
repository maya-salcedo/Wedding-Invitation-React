          <p>We don't need you to bring us gifts, we know plane tickets are
            expensive and your presence at the wedding is enough!</p>
            <p>If you really want to give us something, a contribution to our honeymoon fund
            would be awesome.</p>
        <p> Here's how you can get the money to us:
            Account Name: May Salcedo 
            Account Number: FI29 3939 0050 8098 54. 
            BIC: SBANFIHH
        </p>
       </div>
